Flowing through awe-inspiring landscapes like the Amazon rainforest, the river weaves its way through Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, giving life to countless creatures. From the mighty jaguars prowling the Amazon jungle to the vibrant macaws soaring above the canopy, this remarkable region teems with biodiversity. Deep within the river's currents, magnificent pink river dolphins gracefully glide alongside piranhas and electric eels. Along the riverbanks, you'll find bustling cities like Manaus, where the urban meets the wild, and Iquitos, a gateway to the heart of the Amazon rainforest.
