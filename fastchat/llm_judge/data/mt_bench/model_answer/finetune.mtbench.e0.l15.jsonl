Riemannian geometry is the study of how space and time are bent and curved, and how a particle in a non-uniform field will behave differently if a speed or mass is given.\n2. Riemannian geometry is closely related to the study of the metric tensors, and its use is closely related to the use of tensors in physics.\n3. Riemannian geometry is a natural field of study for quantum mechanics, and some key concepts are used to describe the behavior of quantum particles in space and time.\n4.
